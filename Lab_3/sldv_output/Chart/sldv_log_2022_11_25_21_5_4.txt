Validating cached model representation from 25-Nov-2022 19:39:30...change detected

Creating a new model from the contents of Atomic Subsystem "Chart".

New Model File:D:\Masters\Model Based\Lab_3\sldv_output\Chart\Chart.slx

Model 'ae2e3' is configured for a Variable-step solver. Since Simulink Design Verifier cannot be used with Variable-step solvers, the solver type of the extracted model 'Chart' has been set to Fixed-step discrete with auto step size.
